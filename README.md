# seawall_police

## Hackathon for Good

### Topic: Urban Flood Mitigation

### Description

`seawall_police` offers a simple open-source visualizations seawall geotechnical and structural instruments for data monitoring.

### Motivation

As flooding and climate change becomes a greater risk to coastal cities, the greater need for better seawalls and infrastructure.
For example, the city of New Orleans had catastrophic problems due to levee (one type of an embankment built to prevent the overflow of the sea/river) structural failures - read the story from Wikipedia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_levee_failures_in_Greater_New_Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_levee_failures_in_Greater_New_Orleans).


Seawall structural integrity is crucial to protect coastal communities. Long term health and quality control can be achieved with adequate data monitoring. Current  Data Management Systems used in infrastructure projects cost millions of dollars to use and operate. To ensure long-term life-cycle of our infrastructure projects, structural health monitoring offers the opportunity to supervise the infrastructure works and hold involved operating and construction parties accountable during the process. There is a need a collaborative platform with servers, maps, and info-graphics built on top of existing standards to improve how we monitor public spending.

*Figure 1. Current Geotechnical Technical Data Management Systems are used in infrastructure projects and cost millions of dollars to use and operate. An open-source platform can create a scalable product that can potentially provide free visualizations*

Geo_police is a platform to visualize monitoring instruments real-time. It is open to any user.

Sample data:

inclinometers:

settlement markers:

tiltometers:

We will simulate the data of structural health instruments like inclinimoters, settlement marker, and tiltometers  for the entire coast of the United States.
